        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a 19-year-old Full Stack Developer student at Henry.
            I'm passionate about learning new technologies and building innovative projects.
            Apart from my technical skills, I have also improved my soft skills,
            such as assertive communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, and frustration tolerance.
            These skills have helped me to become a better developer and work more efficiently in a team.</p>
